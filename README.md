## About Course

In this Big Data Processes course, I will learn how to effectively manage and utilize data sets. I will gain skills in data interpretation, visualization, and reasoning about data in larger contexts. By the end of the course, I will be able to identify and describe trends related to Big Data, analyze how organizations derive value from insights, design Big Data Processes for research and organizational issues, conduct and report analytical insights using visualization and metrics, and reflect on the implications of Big Data processes.

## Prerequisites

This course is available to all DIM students. As a non-DIM student, I should have basic literacy in a programming language (for instance R or Python), corresponding to an introductory course in programming or equivalent.
