As \"dataset_csv\" is a variable we create, we decide what the name should be. Some find it helpful to name their datasets after the content of the file, e.g, \"health\", others just name their dataframes df, and that is perfectly okay too. You just need to remember that you will be writing the name of the dataframe often and names like: the_health_data_of_several_different_countries might not be the most effective name. As you progress you might work with several different dataframes in your Jupyter Notebook, so keeping a list of what the different dataframes contain might be helpful \n",
    "- \"pd\" is the alias we used for the library Pandas. In other words, we are telling Python that we want to use Pandas to read the file (= \"pd.read_csv\")\n",
    "- \"Data.txt\" is the name of the file we want to open. To be able to open it like this, the Jupyter Notebook and the file needs to be saved in the same folder\n",
    "- \"delimiter\" is a so-called 'parameter' which we use to tell Python how the values are separated in the file. As you might remember when examining the txt-file, the \"columns\" in the Data.txt is seperatedby tabs (spaces) and therefore, we choose the delimiter '\\t' (which stands for tab)"
